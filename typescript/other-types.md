## Other Types

Let's go through the concepts of `any`, `object`, `unknown`, and `never` in TypeScript:

1. **`any`:**
   - `any` is a type that represents a dynamic or untyped value. It essentially opts out of the static type checking that TypeScript provides.
   - Example:

     ```typescript
     let value: any = 10;
     value = "Hello";
     value = { key: "value" };
     ```

   - While `any` provides flexibility, it comes at the cost of losing type safety.

2. **`object`:**
   - In TypeScript, `object` is a type that represents any non-primitive type. It can refer to anything except `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null`, or `undefined`.
   - Example:

     ```typescript
     let obj: object = { key: "value" };
     let arr: object = [1, 2, 3];
     ```

   - Note that `object` is a broad type, and it does not provide information about the specific structure of the object.

3. **`unknown`:**
   - `unknown` is a type-safe counterpart of `any`. It represents a value about which you have no information. You cannot perform operations on values of type `unknown` unless you assert or narrow the type.
   - Example:

     ```typescript
     let userInput: unknown;
     let userName: string;

     userInput = 10;
     userName = userInput as string; // Type assertion

     if (typeof userInput === "string") {
       userName = userInput; // Type narrowing
     }
     ```

   - The benefit of `unknown` is that it forces you to perform type checks before using the value.

4. **`never`:**
   - `never` is a type that represents a value that will never occur. It is often used for functions that throw exceptions, infinite loops, or never return.
   - Example:

     ```typescript
     function throwError(message: string): never {
       throw new Error(message);
     }

     function infiniteLoop(): never {
       while (true) {
         // Infinite loop
       }
     }
     ```

   - The use of `never` indicates to TypeScript that the function will not reach its end or return a value.

These types serve different purposes: `any` for maximum flexibility, `object` for non-primitive types, `unknown` for type-safe dynamic values, and `never` for indicating unreachable or infinite operations. It's recommended to use them judiciously to maintain type safety in your TypeScript code.

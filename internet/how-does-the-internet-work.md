### Overview
The internet is like a giant web that connects computers all around the world. Think of it as a highway with special stops called **routers**. When you send something on the internet, it's like sending a package. The package is broken into tiny pieces called packets and travels from your computer to a router, then to the next one, until it reaches its destination.

To make sure everything goes smoothly, the internet uses special rules called protocols. Two important ones are Internet Protocol (IP) for directing the packets and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to make sure they reach the right place in the right order.

Besides these rules, there are other cool things like the Domain Name System (DNS) that helps translate website names, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web pages, and the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to keep things safe.

### Basic Concept
some important words to help you understand how it works:

1. **Packet**: Like a small message that travels on the internet.

2. **Router**: Like a guide that helps messages go to the right places on the internet.

3. **IP Address**: A special code for each device on the internet, so messages know where to go.

4. **Domain Name**: Like the name of a website that people can read, for example, google.com.

5. **DNS**: This is like a translator that changes the website's name into a special code (IP Address).

6. **HTTP**: A way for your computer (or tablet!) to talk to a website.

7. **HTTPS**: A super-safe way for your computer to talk to a website, so nobody can listen.

8. **SSL/TLS**: Special guards that keep conversations between your computer and a website secret and safe.

### The role of Protocols in internet
1. **IP**: It helps messages find their way to the right place on the internet.

2. **TCP and UDP**: They make sure messages get there safely and quickly.

3. **DNS**: It's like a translator changing website names into IP address that computers understand.

4. **HTTP**: It's how your computer talks to a website.

The cool thing is, because everyone follows the same rules (like IP and HTTP), different companies' devices can talk to each other easily. So, a computer from one company can chat with a website from another company without any problems!
